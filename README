This project is based on jeremyherbert's stm32-templates, found at https://github.com/jeremyherbert/stm32-templates.  He did a great job getting a working platform for the STM32F4-Discovery, but we want to simplify things a bit.

The goal is to create a base for the STM32F4-Discovery that does not require so many of STM's library, using our own startup file and reducing dependency on extra libraries.

This project will only focus on the STM32F4, so all STM32VL files have been removed.
